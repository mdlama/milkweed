# Initialization

```{r}
library(milkweed)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(AICcmodavg)
library(vegan)
library(flextable)
library(webshot)
```

# Flowering

```{r}
flower.data = full.data %>% filter(!is.na(h_apical), !is.na(fec.flower))
```

## Forward selection

Here's the model with height as the only predictor to compare against.
```{r}
flower.height = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.herb = glm(fec.flower ~ herb_avg, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.N = glm(fec.flower ~ N, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.LMA = glm(fec.flower ~ LMA, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.ADL = glm(fec.flower ~ ADL, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.Card = glm(fec.flower ~ Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

aictab(list(flower.height, flower.herb, flower.N, flower.LMA, flower.ADL, flower.Card),
       modnames = c("height", "herb", "N", "LMA", "ADL", "Card"))
```

Here are the models that contain height and 1 other additional predictor. We want to see if any of these are a better fit than height alone.
```{r}
flower.haherb = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + herb_avg, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haN = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + N, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haLMA = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + LMA, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haADL = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + ADL, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haCard = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

aictab(list(flower.height, flower.haherb, flower.haN, flower.haLMA, flower.haADL, flower.haCard), modnames = c('height', 'height + herb', 'height + N', 'height + LMA', 'height + ADL', 'height + Card'))
```

Now adding third variable:
```{r}
flower.haCardherb = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + herb_avg, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haCardN = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + N, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haCardLMA = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + LMA, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haCardADL = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + ADL, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

aictab(list(flower.haCard, flower.haCardherb, flower.haCardN, flower.haCardLMA, flower.haCardADL), modnames = c('height + Card', 'height + Card + herb', 'height + Card + N', 'height + Card + LMA', 'height + Card + ADL'))
```

Four variables
```{r}
flower.haCardherbN = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + herb_avg + N, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haCardherbLMA = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + herb_avg + LMA, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haCardherbADL = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + herb_avg + ADL, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

aictab(list(flower.haCardherb, flower.haCardherbN, flower.haCardherbLMA, flower.haCardherbADL),
       c('height + Card + herb', 'height + Card + herb + N', 'height + Card + herb + LMA', 'height + Card + herb + ADL'))
```

Not much difference for LMA.

Five variables.
```{r}
flower.haCardherbLMAN = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + herb_avg + LMA + N, data = flower.data, family = binomial())
flower.haCardherbLMAADL = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + Cardenolides + herb_avg + LMA + ADL, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

aictab(list(flower.haCardherb, flower.haCardherbLMA, flower.haCardherbLMAN, flower.haCardherbLMAADL), 
       modnames = c('height + Card + herb', 'height + Card + herb + LMA', 'height + Card + herb + LMA + N', 'height + Card + herb + LMA + ADL'))
```

Let's create the full table for publication:
```{r}
fAIC <- aictab(list(flower.height, flower.herb, flower.N, flower.LMA, flower.ADL, flower.Card, flower.haherb, flower.haN, flower.haLMA, flower.haADL, flower.haCard, flower.haCardherb, flower.haCardN, flower.haCardLMA, flower.haCardADL, flower.haCardherbN, flower.haCardherbLMA, flower.haCardherbADL, flower.haCardherbLMAADL, flower.haCardherbLMAN),
       modnames = c("height", "herb", "N", "LMA", "ADL", "Card", 'height + herb', 'height + N', 'height + LMA', 'height + ADL', 'height + Card', 'height + Card + herb', 'height + Card + N', 'height + Card + LMA', 'height + Card + ADL', 'height + Card + herb + N', 'height + Card + herb + LMA', 'height + Card + herb + ADL', 'height + Card + herb + LMA + ADL', 'height + Card + herb + LMA + N'))
fAIC
```

Let's format this puppy:
```{r}
ft <- flextable(fAIC) %>%
  add_header(Modnames = "Flowering") %>%
  fontsize(part = "header", size = 12) %>%
  set_header_labels(Modnames = "Model") %>% 
  bg(i = 2, bg = "#dedede") %>% 
  width(j = ~ Modnames, width = 2.6) %>%
  set_formatter(
    K = function(x) sprintf("%d", x)
  )
ft
```

Now save as image:
```{r}
# create an Rmd file ----
rmd_name <- tempfile(fileext = ".Rmd")
cat("```{r echo=FALSE}\nft\n```", file = rmd_name)

# render as an html file ----
html_name <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")
rmarkdown::render(rmd_name, output_format = "html_document", output_file = html_name)

# get a png from the html file with webshot ----
webshot(html_name, zoom = 2, file = "floweringAIC.png", 
        selector = "body > div.container-fluid.main-container > div.tabwid > table")
```

## Backward Selection

```{r}
flower.full = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + herb_avg + N + LMA + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.height = glm(fec.flower ~ herb_avg + N + LMA + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.herb = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + N + LMA + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.N = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + herb_avg + LMA + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.LMA = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + herb_avg + N + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.Card = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + herb_avg + N + LMA, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

aictab(list(flower.full, flower.height, flower.herb, flower.N, flower.LMA, flower.Card), 
       modnames = c("height + herb + N + LMA + Card", 
                    "herb + N + LMA + Card",
                    "height + N + LMA + Card",
                    "height + herb + LMA + Card",
                    "height + herb + N + Card",
                    "height + herb + N + LMA"))
```

Dropping N.
```{r}
flower.N_height = glm(fec.flower ~ herb_avg + LMA + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.N_herb = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + LMA + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.N_LMA = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + herb_avg + Cardenolides, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

flower.N_Card = glm(fec.flower ~ h_apical + herb_avg + LMA, data = flower.data, family = binomial())

aictab(list(flower.N, flower.N_height, flower.N_herb, flower.N_LMA, flower.N_Card), 
       modnames = c("height + herb + LMA + Card", 
                    "herb + LMA + Card",
                    "height + LMA + Card",
                    "height + herb + Card",
                    "height + herb + LMA"))
```

Full table for publications.
```{r}
fAIC <- aictab(list(flower.full, flower.height, flower.herb, flower.N, flower.LMA, flower.Card, flower.N_height, flower.N_herb, flower.N_LMA, flower.N_Card),

                    "herb + N + LMA + Card",
                    "height + N + LMA + Card",
                    "height + herb + LMA + Card",
                    "height + herb + N + Card",

                    "height + LMA + Card",
                    "height + herb + Card",
                    "height + herb + LMA"
                    ))
fAIC
```

Let's format this puppy:
```{r}

  fontsize(part = "header", size = 12) %>%

```

```

Let's format this puppy:
```{r}
ft <- flextable(pAIC) %>%
  add_header(Modnames = "Number of Pods") %>%
  fontsize(part = "header", size = 12) %>%
  bg(i = 1, bg = "#dedede") %>% 
  set_header_labels(Modnames = "Model") %>% 
  width(j = ~ Modnames, width = 2.6) %>%
  set_formatter(
    K = function(x) sprintf("%d", x)
  )
ft
```

Now save as image:
```{r}
# create an Rmd file ----
rmd_name <- tempfile(fileext = ".Rmd")
cat("```{r echo=FALSE}\nft\n```", file = rmd_name)

# render as an html file ----
html_name <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")
rmarkdown::render(rmd_name, output_format = "html_document", output_file = html_name)

# get a png from the html file with webshot ----
webshot(html_name, zoom = 2, file = "podsAIC.png", 
        selector = "body > div.container-fluid.main-container > div.tabwid > table")
```

## Backward selection

```{r}
pods.full = glm(N_pods ~ h_apical + herb_avg + N + LMA + Cardenolides, data = pods.data, family = poisson())
pods.height = glm(N_pods ~ herb_avg + N + LMA + Cardenolides, data = pods.data, family = poisson())

                    "height + herb + N + Card",
                    "height + herb + N + LMA"))
```

Dropping N.
```{r}
pods.N_height = glm(N_pods ~ herb_avg + LMA + Cardenolides, data = pods.data, family = poisson())

pods.N_herb = glm(N_pods ~ h_apical + LMA + Cardenolides, data = pods.data, family = poisson())

pods.N_LMA = glm(N_pods ~ h_apical + herb_avg + Cardenolides, data = pods.data, family = poisson())

pods.N_Card = glm(N_pods ~ h_apical + herb_avg + LMA, data = pods.data, family = poisson())

aictab(list(pods.N, pods.N_height, pods.N_herb, pods.N_LMA, pods.N_Card), 
       modnames = c("height + herb + LMA + Card", 
                    "herb + LMA + Card",
                    "height + LMA + Card",
                    "height + herb + Card",
