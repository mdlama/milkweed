Load data.
```{r}
data(stemdata)
stemdata <- tbl_df(stemdata)
```

Compute budlings per stem.
```{r}
data_gp <- stemdata %>% 
  group_by(year, transect) %>% 
  summarize(N_seedlings = sum(seedling, na.rm=T), 
            N_total = sum(aliveJune, na.rm=T), 
            N_budlings = N_total - N_seedlings,

            site = first(site)) %>%
  ungroup(year, transect) %>%
  ##NOTE: these 4 bind_rows() calls add in explicit 0s where transects died off, resulting in a year with 0 stems, necessary as it would skew the model if it were not included

  bind_rows(data.frame(year = 2016, transect = 63, N_seedlings = 0, N_total = 0, N_budlings = 0, herb_mean = 0, site = "YTB")) %>%

  group_by(transect) %>%

data15_16 <- data_gp %>% filter(year %in% 2015:2016 & transect != 80) %>% #transect 80 was abandoned after 2015 so was not included
  group_by(transect) %>%

Also, transects 60, 61, 62 are not present in 2017 since they died, so they are excluded.
  group_by(transect) %>%
  summarize(bdlgs_per_stem = last(N_budlings)/first(N_total),
            herb_mean = first(herb_mean),
            site = first(site))

fulldat <- bind_rows(data13_14, data14_15, data15_16, data16_17)
```

Let's average over transects.

```{r}
merged <- fulldat %>% group_by(transect) %>% 
  summarize(herb_mean = mean(herb_mean),
            bdlgs_per_stem = mean(bdlgs_per_stem),
            site = first(site)) %>%
  filter(!is.nan(herb_mean)) %>%
  filter(!is.nan(bdlgs_per_stem))
```

Model fits.
```{r}
exp.model <- lm(log(bdlgs_per_stem) ~ herb_mean, data=merged)
lin.model <- lm(bdlgs_per_stem ~ herb_mean, data=merged)
cst.model <- lm(bdlgs_per_stem ~ 1, data=merged)
AICc(cst.model)
AICc(lin.model)
AICc(exp.model)
```

Linear is the best fit, following behind by the constant model.
```{r}
fit <- lin.model 

plotdata <- data.frame(herb_avg = fit$model$herb_mean, 
                       buds_per_stem = fit$model$bdlgs_per_stem,
                       site = merged$site)

p <- plotdata %>% ggplot(aes(x = herb_avg, 
                             y = buds_per_stem,
                             color = site)) + 
                  geom_point()

xpts <- seq(from=0, to=2, length.out = 1000)
ypts <- predict(fit, 
                new = data.frame(herb_mean = xpts), 
                level=0.95,
                interval="confidence",
                se.fit=TRUE)
plotdata <- data.frame(herb_avg = xpts, 
                       buds_per_stem = ypts$fit[,"fit"],
                       lwr = ypts$fit[,"lwr"],
                       upr = ypts$fit[,"upr"],
                       site = NA)

         geom_ribbon(data = plotdata, 
                     aes(ymin=lwr, 
                         ymax=upr), 
                     alpha = 0.2) + 
         scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 2.0))
